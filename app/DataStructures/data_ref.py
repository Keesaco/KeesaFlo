	## \brief Constructor for the data_ref object.
	# \param self - instance reference
	# \param path - path through which the data can be located in the data store
	# \param start - (= 0) the start point of the data to be included in analysis
	# \param end - (= 0) the end point of the data to be included in analysis

	# \note Will fail if end is less than start.
	# \note Setting both start and end to 0 (as is default) will include all of the available data in analysis.
	# \warning Does not check that the path for the data exists.
